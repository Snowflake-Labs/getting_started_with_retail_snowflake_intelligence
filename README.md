## 🏁 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the demo running:

### 1️⃣ Database Setup

Run the setup script to create all necessary Snowflake objects:

```sql
-- Execute in Snowflake worksheet
-- Copy and paste contents of scripts/setup.sql
```

This will create:
- Database: `SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE`
- Warehouse: `RETAIL_SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE_WH`
- Role: `RETAIL_SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE_ROLE`
- Tables and views for data analysis

### 4️⃣ Cleanup (Optional)

When you're done exploring, clean up the resources:

```sql
-- Execute in Snowflake worksheet
-- Copy and paste contents of scripts/teardown.sql
```

## 🔧 Configuration

The setup script will create all necessary Snowflake objects including:
- 🗄️ Databases: SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE, RETAIL_SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE_DB
- 📂 Schemas: ANALYTICS, AGENTS
- ⚡ Warehouses: RETAIL_SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE_WH
- 👤 Roles: RETAIL_SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE_ROLE
- 📋 Tables & Views: 9 data objects for analysis
